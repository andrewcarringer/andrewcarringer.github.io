This past year, I changed a few things about my school plans. Instead of graduating in December, I changed my German minor to a major, and will graduate in May 2018. I think it's a good tradeoff to take an "extra" (not really for me) semester for a whole other degree. I can technically get dual degrees instead of a double major, so that's neat.

Last football season ended with a great trip to Arizona, unlike the previous year's somewhat annoying trip. The game also went differently than last year: we were crushed by Clemson 31-0. The game was torture to sit through, and I was upset that we wouldn't be going on another trip, but I still had an overall good time in Phoenix.

This summer I attempted to get internships in cities like L.A. and Chicago, but nothing worked out unfortunately. I continue to do a little bit of work for a WCBE radio program called You Inc. and now I'm going to do a bit of work for Greater Columbus Sister Cities International. GCSCI seems like a great organization to be involved with since I'm so interested in having a career in international relations / communication / business / who knows what.

I'm preparing to submit an application to be an English teaching Assistant through Fulbright in Germany. Speaking German has a perk in this situation, because I can also apply to Austria, which has a related program for English teaching that I would be able to also apply for. Fulbright only allows one application, so most people don't have the "second chance" that Austria provides. I really hope I get to be involved with Fulbright after college, but I worry that the U.S. government could pull some funding and reduce my chances of going. I remain hopeful, however, that I will be able to experience living on my own in another country sometime after recieving my degrees.

Another really cool opportunity that will hopefully happen involves the OSU Alumni Band being invited to play some concerts in southern Germany and Austria. They would be there during my time as an English teaching assistant, so if I am there I might be able to travel down and play with them.

This summer I've been attending summer sessions and working out diligently to ty to be healthier. I've been eating more salads and vegetables, and I've now made it a point that I'm going to avoid red meats more often. I don't plan on eating red meats at home, but I'm not ruling out eating some when going out to eat.

I hope that this coming year I can live a healthier and more active life, and fulfil my goals for international exploration.


Seit letztes Jahr habe ich meine Schuleplänen geandert. Anstatt ich in December graduiere, habe ich meine Deutsche Nebenfach zu ein Hauptfach verandert und ich werde in Mai 2018 graduiere. Ich fühle, dass diese Entscheidung ist ein guter Kompromiss, weil ich nur ein zusätzliches Semester für ein zusätzliches Diplom nehmen mussen. Anstatt ich ein Doppelhauptfach bekommen, kann ich Zwei Diplome bekommen, also ist das für mich gut.
