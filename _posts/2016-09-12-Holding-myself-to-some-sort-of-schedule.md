My school workload is starting to ramp up, with group projects beginning in my COMM courses. Band continues to take a lot of time out of my life, and I am also expected to take care of a lot of graphic design work for eSports Initiative, but I am going to try to create a new blog post once a week on Mondays. I have no classes on Mondays, so I should be fine with this goal.

This Friday, the Marching Band will be flying out to Norman, Oklahoma to support the team. Our report time is 5:30 a.m., so that'll be awful, but the game should be exciting. It was announced today that we'll be playing at a pep rally in Oklahoma's basketball arena for a sold-out crowd of Ohio State fans. I find it amazing that our fans travel so well. The whole thing should be quite an experience.

I will probably make my next blog post all about my experience in Oklahoma, and will be working on it while I'm there to get a lot of the details down on paper while they're fresh, so expect a long one. I should also have pictures, but I'll need to first understand how to upload them here.

Go Bucks.

Meine Studien beginnen schwieriger zu sein, mit Gruppenprojeckten in meinen COMM Kursen beginnen. Der Spielmannszug macht weiter meine Zeit zu nehmen, und ich muss auch f√ºr eSports Initiative Grafik sorgen, aber ich werde versuchen, einen neuen Blog-Post jeden Montag zu erstellen. Ich habe keine Klassen montags, also soll ich mit dieses Ziel fein sein.
